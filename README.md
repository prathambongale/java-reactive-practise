# Java-reactive-practise
This repo consist of all the practise programs written for Java Reactive


## Notes
> 1. Mono will emit 0 or 1 item. Followed by an onComplete/ onError.
> 2. You can always build the reactive pipeline. But it will only get exicuted when the subscribe() is called. <br>
> 3. Anything things else other than the pipeline will get printed even if the subscribe() is not called. Please run the program Lec06SupplierRefactoring.java for better understanding. <br>
